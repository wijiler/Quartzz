# Quartzz -  Beautiful code,Beatiful performance



## Why make a new language? theres so many out there you wont make a mark  

I am of the opinion that there is no good language but I am trying to bridge that gap with simplicity,explicivity,and speed.

## The 3 principles of quartzz
### Simplicity
Simple code is better code, I come from a background of mechanical engineering where the reason people make simple contraptions that may be more expensive is because of how servicable it is. I apply this logic to programmming where simple code is scalable code that when fails you can pinpoint what fails.
### Explicivity
If I can look at your code for a few minutes and get a deep understanding of it I consider it good code. This is why in quartzz there is no type inferencing,there is minimal shorthand,function tags,and there is little keywords.
### Speed
Speed is an essential component of computer programming, although I value Explicivity over speed which is why I don't use alienspeak algorithms, I cannot stop you from speaking alien.
